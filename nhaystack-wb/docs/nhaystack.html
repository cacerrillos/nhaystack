<h2><img src="tag.png" alt="NHaystack" title="" /> NHaystack</h2>

<p>NHaystack is an open-source <a href="http://www.niagaraax.com/">Niagara AX</a> module 
that enables Niagara stations (JACE and WebSupervisor) to act as either servers 
<em>or</em> clients in the <a href="http://project-haystack.org">Project Haystack</a> format, via 
a <a href="http://project-haystack.org/doc/Rest">RESTful</a> protocol.  Using NHaystack, 
external applications receive data that includes essential meta data (tags) 
to describe the meaning of the data. </p>

<p>When acting as a server, NHaystack automatically generates standard tags for 
all the ControlPoints in your system.  This feature allows for connecting 
immediately to the Niagara Station via Haystack once the NHaystack module has 
been installed, without requiring any further configuration.  It makes 
discovering the points in your station as easy as issuing a simple query.</p>

<p>NHaystack-as-a-server also streamlines the process of adding user-specified 
Haystack tags to Niagara systems, by providing a GUI tool that allows users to 
add the tags directly to Niagara components. Once tags have been defined, the 
data associated with the Niagara components, including the tags, are available 
over the Rest communications interface. This combination of the tagging tool 
and the Haystack protocol "engine" reduces the effort involved in connecting 
Niagara data to external software applications.</p>

<p>NHaystack can also act as a Haystack client, via an AX driver that models
remote servers as AX devices. This allows haystack devices to exist "underneath"
AX stations.  See Section 7 of this document for an explanation of how that works.</p>

<p>NHaystack is licensed under the

<p>The development of NHaystack has been funded by 
<a href="http://www.j2inn.com">J2 Innovations</a>.  </p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<ul>
<li>The ability to include meta data tags as part of Niagara data structures

acquired from a Niagara system.</li>
<li>The Haystack HTTP protocol is efficient and includes features coalesce 
requests to minimize network traffic and message size.</li>
<li>The NHaystack module includes extensive features under the covers to unify 
real time and historical data structures in Niagara, which greatly simplifies 
access to data, and presentation in third party applications.</li>

inside of AX.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Using NHaystack as a server</h3>

<p>To get started with exposing an AX station as a haystack server, install 
nhaystack.jar into an AX station.  Then open the nhaystack palette in 
Workbench, and drag-and-drop the NHaystackService onto the "/Services" folder 
of your station.</p>

<p>This is all you need to do to get rolling.  Your station is now automatically
serving up all its ControlPoint objects and Histories as haystack 
<code>point</code> <a href="http://project-haystack.org/doc/TagModel#entities">recs</a>, via the 
<a href="http://project-haystack.org/doc/Rest">Haystack REST Api</a>. 
Many of the tags that are defined as being associated with <code>points</code>, like 
<code>kind</code>, <code>unit</code>, <code>tz</code>, <code>his</code>, <code>cur</code>, etc. are automatically generated for you.</p>

<h3>2. How point recs are generated</h3>

<p>In Niagara AX, ControlPoints and Histories exist in separate namespaces. 
There is one object in the station database which represents the current state 
of the point, (including its current value, actions to command it, and so 
forth), and a different object to represent its historical log of 
timestamp/value pairs. </p>

<p>However, in Haystack, a <code>point</code> rec models both of these concepts in one
object.  A <code>point</code> rec can have both a <code>cur</code> tag,
which indicates the <code>point</code> has capability for subscription to its real-time 
current value, and it can have a <code>his</code> tag, which indicates that a 
<code>point</code> is historized with a history log of timestamp/value pairs.</p>

<p>NHaystack handles this mismatch by unifiying the AX namespaces.
It automatically maps ControlPoints and Histories together 
so that only one Haystack rec is generated, with both a <code>cur</code> tag and a 
<code>his</code> tag.  If only one of the objects is present, then either 
the <code>cur</code> tag or this <code>his</code> tag is generated, but not both.  Lets 
look at a couple of examples showing how this works.  </p>

<h4>2.1 A simple station</h4>

<p>First lets take a simple example of a Niagara station that has two 
ControlPoints in it , with no History collection for those ControlPoints.
The station will look similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>station:|slot:/AHU1/NumericWritable
station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable
history:/my_station/AuditHistory
history:/my_station/LogHistory
</code></pre>

<p>This station will automatically have four <code>point</code> recs: two for the 
ControlPoints, and two for the Histories.  The first two will have a <code>cur</code> 
tag, but no <code>his</code> tag, and the second two will have a <code>his</code> tag but 
no <code>cur</code> tag.</p>

<pre><code>{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/NumericWritable           
{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable           
{point,his} history:/my_station/AuditHistory 
{point,his} history:/my_station/LogHistory
</code></pre>

<p>Now lets add a NumericCov extension to the NumericWritable and enable it.
Whenever we make a structural change to a station, by adding or removing a
Component or History, we must invoke an action on the NHaystackService called
<code>rebuildCache</code>.  Invoking <code>rebuildCache</code> causes the 
NHaystack Server to traverse through the entire station and rebuild 
all of its internal data structures, so it can keep track of how everything 
in the station is interrelated.</p>

<p>After we invoke <code>rebuildCache</code>, the station will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{point,cur,his} station:|slot:/AHU1/NumericWritable
{point,cur}     station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable
{point,his}     history:/my_station/AuditHistory
{point,his}     history:/my_station/LogHistory
----            history:/my_station/NumericWritable
</code></pre>

<p>The station still has the same four <code>point</code> recs.  However, a <code>his</code> tag has
been added to the NumericWritable <code>point</code>.  If a <a href="http://project-haystack.org/doc/Ops#hisRead">hisRead</a> on that 
<code>point</code> is performed, the NHaystack Server will fetch the timestamp/value pairs 
for the associated History.  The History for NumericWritable does not have its 
own rec created, because it has been unified with the NumericWritable.</p>

<p>By the way, the <code>id</code> tags that are generated for these recs consist of
a single character, either "c" or "h" (which indicates whether the rec comes
from the ComponentSpace or HistorySpace), followed by a ".", and then followed
by a Uri-friendly Base64 encoding of either the slotPath or the historyId.</p>

<p>As a final example from this simple station, lets delete the NumericWritable
and then invoke <code>rebuildCache</code>.  The station now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable           
{point,his} history:/my_station/AuditHistory 
{point,his} history:/my_station/LogHistory   
{point,his} history:/my_station/NumericWritable
</code></pre>

<p>We still have four <code>point</code> recs.  However, the first rec is now gone.  In its
place we have a <code>point</code> rec for the NumericWritable History.  Note that this 
rec has a different <code>id</code> than the rec that has disappeared.</p>

<h4>2.2 A more complex station</h4>

<p>Now lets look at a more complex station -- one that is similar to what
one often sees on an AX Supervisor.  A very frequent case for supervisors is 
that they just import lots of Histories from jaces.</p>

<pre><code>----        station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace1/Histories/Remote_NumericWritable
----        station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace1/Histories/Remote_BooleanWritable
----        station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace2/Histories/Remote_NumericWritable
----        station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace2/Histories/Remote_BooleanWritable
{point,his} history:/supervisor/AuditHistory
{point,his} history:/supervisor/LogHistory
{point,his} history:/jace1/NumericWritable
{point,his} history:/jace1/BooleanWritable
{point,his} history:/jace2/NumericWritable
{point,his} history:/jace2/BooleanWritable
</code></pre>

<p>This station has six recs:  two for the station's own audit and log Histories, 
and four for the imported Histories.  Note that the four NiagaraHistoryImport 
objects do not have a <code>point</code> associated with them.</p>

<p>Now lets change the station by importing the ControlPoints for the first jace,
and running <code>rebuildCache</code>.  Here is what the station looks like now:</p>

<pre><code>{point,cur,his} station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace1/points/NumericWritable
{point,cur,his} station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace1/points/BooleanWritable
----            station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace1/Histories/Remote_NumericWritable
----            station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace1/Histories/Remote_BooleanWritable
----            station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace2/Histories/Remote_NumericWritable
----            station:|slot:/Drivers/NiagaraNetwork/jace2/Histories/Remote_BooleanWritable
{point,his}     history:/supervisor/AuditHistory
{point,his}     history:/supervisor/LogHistory
----            history:/jace1/NumericWritable
----            history:/jace1/BooleanWritable
{point,his}     history:/jace2/NumericWritable
{point,his}     history:/jace2/BooleanWritable
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that the two Histories from jace1 no longer have their own 
auto-generated rec.  Instead, the two imported ControlPoints know about those 
Histories, and will export them via <a href="http://project-haystack.org/doc/Ops#hisRead">hisRead</a>.  NHaystack creates this 
linkage by analyzing the relationships between imported ControlPoints found 
under a NiagaraPointDeviceExt, imported NiagaraHistoryImports found under a 
NiagaraHistoryDeviceExt, and the Histories found in the station's HistorySpace.</p>

<h4>2.3 curVal and curStatus</h4>

<p>If NHaystack creates a <a href="http://project-haystack.org/tag/cur">cur</a> tag, then it will also create a
<a href="http://project-haystack.org/tag/curStatus">curStatus</a> tag, and (usually) a <a href="http://project-haystack.org/tag/curVal">curVal</a> tag.</p>

<p>In AX, a Status value is a set of flags, and at least in theory a given Status
can contain any combination of the flags.  However, in the haystack tagging
system, <code>curStatus</code> always only has exactly one value -- one of "ok", "fault",
"down", "disabled", or "unknown".</p>

<p>NHaystack translates from an AX Status to curStatus by checking the following
AX Status flags in order:</p>

<pre><code>AX ok       maps to `curStatus`:"ok"
AX disabled maps to `curStatus`:"disabled"
AX fault    maps to `curStatus`:"fault"
AX down     maps to `curStatus`:"down
</code></pre>

<p><em>Anything else</em> (overridden, null, alarm, stale, unackedAlarm) is simply
translated into <code>curStatus</code>:"ok".</p>

<p>NHaystack creates a <code>curVal</code> tag <em>only</em> if <code>curStatus</code> is "ok" <em>and</em> the AX
status is not null. This means that if a point in AX has the "null" status flag
set, then it will be reported with a curStatus of "ok", but it will simply not
have a curVal.</p>

<h3>3. Tagging via the "haystack" slot</h3>

<p>For many use cases of NHaystack, you will not need to do any explicit tagging
on the station.  However, sometimes you want to actually add tags to the 
recs that are generated.  NHaystack supports this via the following convention: 
if there is a slot called "haystack" on a Component, and that slot is of type 
<code>nhaystack:HDict</code>, then the tags which are saved in that slot are exported
in the rec along with all the auto-generated tags.  There is a Workbench
FieldEditor for HDict which allows you to edit these tags.  In addition, this
FieldEditor shows you all the auto-generated tags (though you cannot edit 
them). </p>

<p>You can add this slot via the SlotSheet View for the Component.  However this
is very tedious when you have to do it to many Components, so nhaystack 
provides a better way.  There is a Workbench View on NHaystackService that has 
an area that you can drag-and-drop Components into. The area says "Drag 
Components here to add a 'haystack' slot".  When you drop Components there,
they will have a <code>nhaystack:HDict</code> "haystack" slot added automatically.</p>

<p>There is a special tag called "axAnnotated" that is automatically generated
for those Components that have a "haystack" slot.  This can be helpful if you
need to query your system to figure out which parts of it have already been
annotated.</p>

<p>By the way, you may be wondering why <code>nhaystack:HDict</code> doesn't just appear in 
the palette.  The reason for this is that <code>nhaystack:HDict</code> is a <code>baja:Simple</code>, 
and sadly Simples cannot be placed in a palette.</p>

<p>Whenever you alter a tag with the FieldEditor, you usually need to run 
<code>rebuildCache</code>. Its best to just get in the habit of running it any time you
change a tag or alter the structure of a station.</p>

<p>Note that tagging of Histories is not currently supported.  A future version
of NHaystack will probably support this.</p>

<h3>4. How site and equip tags work</h3>

<p>In addition to tagging <code>point</code> recs, you may also want to include <code>site</code> 
and <code>equip</code> recs in your station, and link everything together via 
<code>siteRef</code> and <code>equipRef</code> pointers.  NHaystack does support 
creating this <a href="http://project-haystack.org/doc/Structure">site-equip-point hierarchy</a>. Let's see how it works.</p>

<h4>4.1 Site tagging</h4>

<p>Lets use our simple example station from section 2.1, except we'll add 
an EnumWritable to it. Note that this time we have also listed an entry for 
the parent "AHU1" folder in our simplified view of the station.  </p>

<pre><code>----        station:|slot:/AHU1
{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/NumericWritable
{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable
{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/EnumWritable
{point,his} history:/my_station/AuditHistory
{point,his} history:/my_station/LogHistory
</code></pre>

<p>If you look in the nhaystack palette, you'll see that there are Components for
Site and Equip. Drag a Site over and drop it anywhere in the ComponentSpace, 
and then run <code>rebuildCache</code>.  The station will now look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>{site}      station:|slot:/Richmond
----        station:|slot:/AHU1
{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/NumericWritable           
{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable           
{point,cur} station:|slot:/AHU1/EnumWritable           
{point,his} history:/my_station/AuditHistory 
{point,his} history:/my_station/LogHistory
</code></pre>

<p>Site and Equip already have a "haystack" slot, so you don't have to add
one via the SlotSheet.  Bring up the HDict FieldEditor for the
Site, you'll see that there are quite a few tags you can fill out, like the
various "geo" tags.</p>

<h4>4.2 Equipment versus Controllers</h4>

<p>In Niagara, Controllers are modeled as an object of type <code>driver:Device</code>.
Generally speaking, all ControlPoints exist underneath one of these Devices.</p>

<p>Howerver, in nhaystack there is no one-to-one relationship between an <code>equip</code> 
rec and a Device.  Any Device can have its <code>points</code> belong to more than one 
<code>equip</code>,  and any <code>equip</code> can have <code>points</code> from more than one Device.  </p>

<p>This flexibility allows us to get away completely from the network-centric 
view of the world that one finds in an AX Station.  You can create 
representations of your data that reflect the real-world equipment on your 
site, rather than the layout of your controller network.</p>

<p>The following two sections, 4.3 and 4.4, explain in more detail how this works.</p>

<h4>4.3 Explictly tagging points with equipRef</h4>

<p>Lets continue with our example station from 4.1, and create an <code>equip</code> which 
references out <code>site</code>.  Then lets have a <code>point</code> reference the <code>equip</code>.</p>

<p>First, drag an Equip over from the palette and place it anywhere in the 
station.  Underneath the Site is a good place for it.  Name it "TrashCompactor". </p>

<p>Then edit the <code>equip</code> and assign its <code>siteRef</code> so that it references "Richmond". <br />
Then run <code>rebuildCache</code>.  Next, edit "/AHU1/BooleanWritable", and give it an 
<code>equipRef</code> that references "TrashCompactor".  Run <code>rebuildCache</code> again.</p>

<p>The station will now look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{site}                                 station:|slot:/Richmond
{equip,siteRef="/Richmond"}            station:|slot:/Richmond/TrashCompactor
----                                   station:|slot:/AHU1
{point,cur}                            station:|slot:/AHU1/NumericWritable
{point,cur,equipRef="/TrashCompactor"} station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable
{point,cur}                            station:|slot:/AHU1/EnumWritable
{point,his}                            history:/my_station/AuditHistory
{point,his}                            history:/my_station/LogHistory
</code></pre>

<p>We have now successfully created a very simple site-equip-point hierarchy.
Our nav tree looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Richmond
    TrashCompactor
        BooleanWritable
</code></pre>

<h4>4.4 Implicitly tagging points with equipRef</h4>

<p>We could now continue and mark every single <code>point</code> under 
"AHU1" as belonging to some <code>equip</code>.  However, that is a lot of drudgery, and
its also prone to error.  NHaystack provides us with a better way to do this.</p>

<p>Drag an Equip from the palette, drop it under the "AHU1" folder, and call it 
"my_equip".  Edit the <code>equip</code> so that its its <code>siteRef</code> references "Richmond".  </p>

<p>Next, add an optional "Str" tag called <code>navNameFormat</code> to the <code>equip</code>, and set 
its value to "%parent.displayName%".  The reason for doing this will soon 
become apparent.</p>

<p>Then rebuild the cache. Now observe what has happened:</p>

<pre><code>{site}                                 station:|slot:/Richmond
{equip,siteRef="/Richmond"}            station:|slot:/TrashCompactor
----                                   station:|slot:/AHU1
{equip,siteRef="/Richmond"}            station:|slot:/AHU1/my_equip
{point,cur,equipRef="/AHU1/my_equip"}  station:|slot:/AHU1/NumericWritable
{point,cur,equipRef="/TrashCompactor"} station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable
{point,cur,equipRef="/AHU1/my_equip"}  station:|slot:/AHU1/EnumWritable
{point,his}                            history:/my_station/AuditHistory
{point,his}                            history:/my_station/LogHistory

Site-Equip-Point Nav Tree:
    Richmond
        TrashCompactor
            BooleanWritable
        AHU1
            NumericWritable
            EnumWritable
</code></pre>

<p>All of the <code>points</code> underneath AHU1, except BooleanWritable, have an 
auto-generated <code>equipRef</code> tag which references "/AHU1/equip".  This happens 
because, during the cache rebuild process, NHaystack noticed that those 2 
<code>points</code> had an ancestor which had an <code>equip</code> child.  Since those <code>points</code> were 
not explicitly annotated with an <code>equipRef</code>, NHaystack automatically linked 
them to that ancestors Equip object.</p>

<p>By implicitly tagging <code>points</code> this way, we can automatically generate large 
numbers of <code>equipRef</code> tags without having to visit every <code>point</code>.  </p>

<p>By the way, the reason that we added the <code>navNameFormat</code> to the <code>equip</code> was so
that it would show up in our nav tree as "AHU1", rather than "my_equip". By
default the <code>navName</code> of any object is just its AX displayName, but you
can rig the nav tree so that alternate names are used. This is important 
because you must always ensure that all the children of a nav tree item
have a unique <code>navName</code>.</p>

<p>Lets duplicate the "AHU1" folder (an then <code>rebuildCache</code> of course) to show
how easy creating large nav trees is.  </p>

<p>Before we do though, we'll fix 
our BooleanWritable so it has a better <code>navNameFormat</code>.  Edit the tags for the
BooleanWritable and set its <code>navNameFormat</code> to something like 
"%parent.displayName%_%displayName%".  By performing this step, we ensure that 
all of the points underneath "TrashCompactor" in the nav tree will have a 
unique <code>navName</code>.  Now our nav tree looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Site-Equip-Point Nav Tree:
    Richmond
        TrashCompactor
            AHU1_BooleanWritable
        AHU1
            NumericWritable
            EnumWritable
</code></pre>

<p>Now simply duplicate AHU1 and run <code>rebuildCache</code>.  Our station will look like
this:</p>

<pre><code>{site}                                 station:|slot:/Richmond
{equip,siteRef="/Richmond"}            station:|slot:/TrashCompactor
----                                   station:|slot:/AHU1
{equip,siteRef="/Richmond"}            station:|slot:/AHU1/my_equip
{point,cur,equipRef="/AHU1/my_equip"}  station:|slot:/AHU1/NumericWritable
{point,cur,equipRef="/TrashCompactor"} station:|slot:/AHU1/BooleanWritable
{point,cur,equipRef="/AHU1/my_equip"}  station:|slot:/AHU1/EnumWritable
----                                   station:|slot:/AHU2
{equip,siteRef="/Richmond"}            station:|slot:/AHU2/my_equip
{point,cur,equipRef="/AHU2/my_equip"}  station:|slot:/AHU2/NumericWritable
{point,cur,equipRef="/TrashCompactor"} station:|slot:/AHU2/BooleanWritable
{point,cur,equipRef="/AHU2/my_equip"}  station:|slot:/AHU2/EnumWritable
{point,his}                            history:/my_station/AuditHistory
{point,his}                            history:/my_station/LogHistory

Site-Equip-Point Nav Tree:
    Richmond
        TrashCompactor
            AHU1_BooleanWritable
            AHU2_BooleanWritable
        AHU1
            NumericWritable
            EnumWritable
        AHU2
            NumericWritable
            EnumWritable
</code></pre>

<h3>5. Keeping your data set consistent</h3>

<h4>5.1 Fixing broken refs</h4>

<p>Occasionally when you are working on setting up the relationships between
recs in a station, you will delete a Component that has other Components 
referencing it.  For instance, in the example in 4.4, if we delete 
"TrashCompactor", then both of our BooleanWritables will have an invalid 
equipRef.</p>

<p>To fix this problem, there is an action on NHaystackService called 
<code>removeBrokenRefs</code> that you can invoke.  This action deletes all of the refs 
in the station that do not reference a valid rec.  Each time a broken ref is 
deleted, a message is also generated in the station log telling you which 
Component was fixed.</p>

<p>In a future version of NHaystack, there will be a view on NHaystackService
that will make it easier for you to find the broken refs and fix them.</p>

<h4>5.2 Using TimeZone Aliases</h4>

<p>Sometimes an AX TimeZone (a.k.a BTimeZone) do not map cleanly into a 
Haystack TimeZone (a.k.a HTimeZone).  This happens when the BTimeZone uses
an offset-style TimeZone ID, like "GMT-05:00", rather than a valid 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database">Olson</a> 
ID, like "America/New_York".  When this occurs, you will see errors in your log 
output that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR [11:59:01 04-May-13 GMT-05:00][nhaystack] Cannot create tz tag: Unknown tz: GMT-05:00
</code></pre>

<p>In cases like this, NHaystack simply omits the <code>tz</code> tag for the historized
<code>point</code> in question.</p>

<p>However, NHaystack also allows you to  provide a custom mapping that overcomes 
this problem, via the "timeZoneAliases" folder on your BHaystackService.  Go to 
the nhaystack palette in Workbench, drag a "timeZoneAlias" onto the 
"timeZoneAliases" folder, and configure it so that the bogus AX TimeZone ID, 
like "GMT-05:00", is mapped onto a proper HTimezone, such as 
"America/New_York".  Now when NHaystack is attempting to generate the <code>tz</code> tag, 
it will know how to proceed when it encounters non-Olson timezones.</p>

<p>In a future version of NHaystack, there will be a view on NHaystackService
that will help you find which timezones are invalid in your dataset, but for 
now you must go through your log output, find the "Cannot create tz tag"
error messages, and copy-and-paste the offending TimeZone ID into a 
timeZoneAlias that maps onto the 'real' HTimezone.</p>

<p>Note that if the machine that you are running Workbench from is mis-configured,
it will provide a default HTimeZone of the form "Etc/GMT-5" in your 
timeZoneAlias.  You should not use the HTimeZones from the "Etc" 
region unless you are really sure of what you are doing.  Instead, always use 
the proper geographic region-and-timezone, like "America/New_York".</p>

<h3>6. How IDs are generated</h3>

<p>Each haystack rec must have an ID that uniquely identifies the object that the
rec models.</p>

<p>By default, nhaystack generates IDs based on the slotPath of components (or the
history ID for histories that are not associate with a point).  E.g:</p>

<pre><code>slot:/Foo/SineWave1 --&gt; C.Foo.SineWave1

history:/nhaystack_simple/AuditHistory --&gt; H.nhaystack_simple.AuditHistory
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, the "C" prefix stands for the ComponentSpace, and the "H"
stands for the HistorySpace.</p>

<p>Note that IDs are bi-directionally encoded -- you can always recreate the 
slotPath from an ID and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Special characters in the slotPath are handled by replacing the "$" character 
with a "~" character.  The sole exception to this rule is that "$20", which
represents a single " " character, is replaced with a dash, "-", to improve the 
readability of the IDS.  E.g:</p>

<pre><code>slot:/Foo/Sine$2fWave1 --&gt; C.Foo.Sine~2fWave1
slot:/Foo/Sine$20Wave1 --&gt; C.Foo.Sine-Wave1
</code></pre>

<p>If there is a site-equip-point hierarchy created in the station, then nhaystack
will use that to generate the ID rather than the slotPath.  E.g. if the 
SineWave in the first example was tagged up with an equip and a site, then 
its generated ID might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>slot:/Foo/SineWave1 --&gt; S.Carytown.AHU1.SineWave1
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, there are actually two IDs that can be used to resolve the rec --
the slotPath version, and the Site-Equip-Point version.</p>

<p>Note that older versions of nhaystack used a Base64 encoding of the slot path,
which looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>c.c2xvdDovRm9vL1NpbmVXYXZlMg~~
h.L25oYXlzdGFja19zaW1wbGUvQXVkaXRIaXN0b3J5
</code></pre>

<p>Nhaystack no longer generates IDs with this form, but it can resolve them.</p>

<h3>7. Using NHaystack as a client</h3>

<p>NHaystack can also model remote haystack servers as AX devices.  This is done 
via a standard AX driver that maps the Haystack protocol into the AX driver 
framework.</p>

<p>You do <em>not</em> need to have an NHaystackService installed in your station to do 
this -- the driver is a standalone piece of functionality.  In fact you 
<em>shouldn't</em> have an NHaystackService in the station unless you are acting 
simultaneously as a server and a client.</p>

<p>To get started, open the nhaystack palette in Workbench, open the "drivers" 
sub-folder of the palette, and drag-and-drop the NHaystackNetwork onto the 
"/Drivers" folder of your station.  Then drag an NHaystackServer so that it is 
underneath your NHaystackNetwork.</p>

<p>Next, configure the internetAddress, uriPath, and credentials slots on the
NHaystackServer.  The internetAddress adress should just be the hostname or IP 
address (plus a colon and then the port number if something other than port 
80 is being used).  The uriPath should be of the form "api/myProjectName" if 
the remote server is running FIN|Stack or SkySpark.  If the remote server is an 
AX station that is running nhaystack-as-a-server, then the uriPath should 
simply be "haystack".</p>

<p>After you've configured the NHaystackServer, manually do a ping to make sure its
connected.  Once connectivity has been established, you can go to the "points" 
and "histories" folders of the NHaystackServer object, and discover points and 
histories just like any other Niagara driver.</p>

<p>Note that currently, the driver imports <a href="http://project-haystack.org/tag/point">"Str" points</a>
as Baja BStringPoint and BStringWritable objects, even if the haystack point
has an enum tag which specifies a list allowable values.  BEnumPoint and 
BEnumWritable objects are currently not created by the driver.  Instead, the 
enum tag is stored as a 'range' facet on the AX ControlPoint.</p>
